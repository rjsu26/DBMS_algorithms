To implement different types of caching and use them in a mock client-server system to compare performance. 
#### Implementations: 
1. **_LRU_**: Least Recently Used cache eviction policy
2. **_LFU_** : [To be implemented] Least Frequently Used cache eviction policy
3. **_client. cpp_** : A dummy client putting requests on to the server
4. **_compileRun. sh_** : Bash program to link and execute the programs. To run, use : `chmod +x compileRun.sh; ./compileRun.sh`
