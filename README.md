# DBMS_algorithms

Using MySQL and Python to implement some interesting DBMS algorithms listed in later section of this ReadMe.

--------------------------------------------

### Setup
1. Install MySQL and python package for connecting to MySQL. <a href="https://www.guru99.com/python-mysql-example.html" target="_blank">Guide</a>

2. Initialize a python3 virtual environment and install packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

### Implementations : 
1. **Caching**: A mini client-server architecture with MySQL database with a cache component designed with LRU and LFU policy. 
2. **Schema_related_algorithms**: Implement some DBMS realted algorithms. Detailed description in the folder's readme.
