##  Schema_related_algorithms:

1. **_check_equality_of_2_tables.py_**: Using 2 methods to compare 2 tables with sparesely different values and observing which of the 2 methods(UNION method and Hashing method) is faster.

2.  **_closure. py_** : Implementing a quadratic and a liner time complexity algorithm to find closure of an attribute set in a given Functional Dependency. Also, an algorithm to find closure of a set of Functional Dependencies using the above implemented attribute set closure algorithm. 

3. **_check_for_superkey.py_**: Given an attribute set, check if it is a superkey of the given set of Functional Dependencies. Uses the closure for attribute set algorithm done in `closure.py`
